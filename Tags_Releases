we use tags to mark importnent events 
github extends tag conecpt release , allow us to attache release note and provide links to download archive of our project 

create simple / light weight tag  like bookmark tags 
Simple and lightweight tags simply label a specific commit;
#git tag stable main ( main branch name ) which means the last commit on the main banch 

create release / annotate tags 
an annotated tag allows you to make a tag ,that you can put your information about who did it,
what all the state of the thing is when it was done,

and so there's a tag commit message as well.
#git tag -a v1.0-alpha -m "tag mesage"  commit_id
annotate tag , we have option of using of git show command 
#git show v1.0-alpha

show list of tag 
#git tag --list 


push the tags to github 
#git push origin <tag_name>
or 
push all tags to github 
#git push --tags 
delete tags in git local repos 
#git tag -d <tag_name>
then move over github
#git push orign :<tag_name>

if tag:unstalbe has already associated with commit id in development/ any branch 
then user did  some commits top of unstable commits 
then i want to move / change unstalbe tag name and point to new head with correct tag name ( move tag name to different commit id)
#git tag -f <tag_name> commit_id(latest commit id )
#git tag -f unstable obc22f 


#git config --global  push.followTags true 
So, once you've added that git config setting,
you now have the ability to do a push,and every time you push,
any tags that don't exist out at your repository on origin are going to go ahead and get pushed along with your push.
