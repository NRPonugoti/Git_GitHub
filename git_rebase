Usually git rebase we use whenever we want to squeeze multiple commits into one commit.
Let's assume that I have done five commits but five commits.
I don't want to push it into my repository.
Then I can convert those five commits into a single commit.

for example :

you have 5 commits , 1 commit point to head leave it that commit 
#git rebase -i HEAD~4
