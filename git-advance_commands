anytime we are going to rewrite history and using the amend command is going to rewrite history
we need to be a little bit careful.
change message of last commit 
#git commit --amend 
or 
#git commit --amend -m " change message here"

# cherry-pick 
cherry pick used to move commit_id from one branch(sub-branch) to another branch( main) 
#git cherry-pick <commit_id>
