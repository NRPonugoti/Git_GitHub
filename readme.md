# git pull
git pull do 2 things 
*  it is going to sync our remote repository with local repository
* at the same time it pull all changes into our working directory

# git fetch 
if we use git fetch it is going to sync only our remote repository with our local repository 

# git pull =git fetch +git merge 

# git merge 
it is going to pull all changes from our local repos to working directory 

git merge 

# git clone 
in case  the repository is not exist in our repository then we need to use git clone 

# Git Hub
github is code hosting platform where we can host our repositories 
so other developers can able to use those repositories and do the changes to the same code 

# Adv of github:
we can work with team or we can work collaboratively 
without git hub we cannot able to achive the distributed version control systems
