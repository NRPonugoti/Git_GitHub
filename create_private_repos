his pull request rather then that one what i can do i can add another user as collaborator , so i don't need to approve his commit 
what ever he do on this repos for that i can go 

Setting ----Collaborators----click Invite a collaborator 
if you want to invite users , those users shold 
I'm inviting him as a collaborator whenever we are inviting him as a collaborator.
First thing is this Docker repository should be cloned by this user.
If he is not yet cloned, it doesn't work if I go to the kills.
I will send collaborator invitation and then he will accept my invitation 
then he will clone my public repos and will do some changes as well by user who i ivited 
now user does push changes to my rpos then asking user name and password then user provide his username and password 
then updated changes on my repso because i gave permission to user
