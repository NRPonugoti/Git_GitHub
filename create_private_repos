as owner of this account , i trust another user and i would like to work with him in this proejct 
if that is the case , another user is also work with me closely , he might be doing commits quite frequently so each and every commit I need to come over here and accept 
his pull request rather then that one what i can do i can add another user as collaborator , so i don't need to approve his commit 
what ever he do on this repos for that i can go
