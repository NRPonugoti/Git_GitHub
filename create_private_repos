Adding collaborator to github repos 

as owner of this account , i trust another user and i would like to work with him in this proejct 
if that is the case , another user is also work with me closely , he might be doing commits quite frequently so each and every commit I need to come over here and accept 
his pull request rather then that one what i can do i can add another user as collaborator , so i don't need to approve his commit 
what ever he do on this repos for that i can go 

Setting ----Collaborators----click Invite a collaborator 
if you want to invite users , those users shold 
I'm inviting him as a collaborator whenever we are inviting him as a collaborator.
First thing is this Docker repository should be cloned by this user.
If he is not yet cloned, it doesn't work if I go to the kills.
I will send collaborator invitation and then he will accept my invitation 
then he will clone my public repos and will do some changes as well by user who i ivited 
now user does push changes to my rpos then asking user name and password then user provide his username and password 
then updated changes on my repso because i gave permission to user 


Creating Protecting branch :
we have 3 branches , dev , test, prod
so users push code ponly dev branch and not allow to push any code directly to test abd prod branch 
so i need to protect my test and prod branch 
no one access branch which branch i Protecting 

go to github ---- Setting of repos ------branches-----add branch protection rule 
branch name pattern: main
click Require a pull request before merging
then create a full request 
now I am trying to do some chaanges on main branch and then committed hence it is asking to create new branch for this change 
and then create pull request for merge those changes to main branch 

and this repos has 3 branches 1 maain , 2 dev 
now switch to dev and then make some changes then commited 
hence is showing pull and review request at repos level 
then you click pull and review request and then you need to review one user then he will approve yourchanges 
to main as per settings of main

========================================
tagging a commit 

1. tags are ref's that point to specific commit in GIT history 
2. tagging is generaly used to capture a point in history that is used for a marked version release (i,e v1.0.1)
3. A tag is like a branch that doesn't change
